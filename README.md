# RUNTIME-MANAGER

## Quick-Start


### Pre-requirements

#### Space4ai-design

It is assumed that all the process with Space4ai-design has been done before. For more documentation you can see their [documentation](https://gitlab.polimi.it/ai-sprint/space4ai-d) 

#### Toscarizer
The Toscarizer should been downloaded from the [repository](https://gitlab.polimi.it/ai-sprint/toscarizer) and placed somewhere in your pc. Later, the toscarizer directory will be asked.

#### Install Go
Follow the instructions on [go web page](https://go.dev/doc/install) for the respective computer's operating system.

#### Install Oscar-cli
To install oscar client tool it is necessary to execute:
```sh
go install github.com/grycap/oscar-cli@latest
```
and run 
```sh
oscar-cli --help
```
to verify if it has been installed correctly. For more information see the [documentation](https://docs.oscar.grycap.net/oscar-cli/) 

#### Install minio-cli

follow the steps explained on [minio web page](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html#) 

#### Install Anaconda

follow the steps explained on [anaconda web page](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) 


### RUNTIME-MANAGER

The folder *ai-sprint-design* should be already placed in the working directory.

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.cefriel.it/ai-sprint/runtime-manager.git
cd runtime-manager/
```

#### Enviroment
It is necessary to create the enviroment and activate it, to properly work with the runtime manager.

To create the enviroment:
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
To activate enviorment:
```sh
conda activate runtime-manager
```
To deactivate enviroment if needed:
```sh
conda deactivate
```

#### Step1: Try --help
Go to the folder *runtime-manager/bin*

```sh
python3 runtime_manager_cli.py --help
```
#### Step 2: copy auth.dat 
Copy the file *auth.dat* in the application directory with the same format explained on [IM](https://imdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gstarted.html?highlight=auth#authentication-file). Example: *application_directory/im*

```sh
type = InfrastructureManager; username = user; password = pass
id = ec2; type = EC2; username = AK; password = SK
```
### Step 3: RUNTIME INFRAS

The following command goes to the IM and get the toscas of all the available infrastructures. Then it relates it with the respective InfID and the component name related.

```sh
python3 runtime_manager_cli.py infras --application_dir <APPLICATION DIR> --dir_to_save <DIR TO SAVE THE TOSCA FILES>
```
- application_dir: it is the default folder of the application
- dir_to_save: it is folder to save the tosca files gotten from the IM

### Step 4: RUNTIME TOSCA

This command will install all the toscarizer dependencies and create the new toscas using as references the new production_deployment.yaml and application_dag.yaml.

```sh
python3 runtime_manager_cli.py tosca --application_dir <APPLICATION DIR> --tosca_dir <TOSCARIZER DIRECTORY>
```
The toscas will be saved at the folder *application_dir/aisprint/deployments/optimal_deployment/im*

### Step 5: Evaluate production and apply the differences.

This command will read the production_deployment files, make a comparison between them and make the respective actions about it. (for now only related with the services of the clusters and the change of nodes number of each infrastructure)

```sh
python3 runtime_manager_cli.py difference --application_dir  <APPLICATION DIR>  --old_dir <OPTIONAL DIR TO READ THE OLD TOSCA FILES>  --new_dir <OPTIONAL DIR TO READ THE OLD TOSCA FILES> --remove_bucket --update_infras
```
- application_dir: it is the default folder of the application
- old_dir: directory to read the old tosca files (OPTIONAL)
- new_dir: directory to read the old tosca files (OPTIONAL)
- remove_bucket: it is a flag to remove the old buckets related with the oscar cluster (OPTIONAL)
- update_infras; it is a flag to update the *infras.yaml* which is located at *application_dir/aisprint/deployments/base/im* (OPTIONAL)


### Read OUTPUTS of the infrastructures

```sh
python3 runtime_manager_cli.py outputs --application_dir  <APPLICATION DIR> --dir_to_save <DIR TO SAVE THE OUTPUT FILES>
```
